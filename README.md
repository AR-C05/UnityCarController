## Features

- Realistic car physics for accurate handling and dynamics.
- Smooth and responsive controls for intuitive driving.
- Configurable parameters for acceleration, braking, steering, and more.
- Suspension system for simulating realistic car movements.
- Customizable camera perspectives, such as first-person or third-person views.
- Support for various input methods, including keyboard, gamepad, and touch controls.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. In the Unity Editor, navigate to the **Scenes** folder.

4. Open the main game scene to start working with the Car Controller.

## Usage

1. Attach the Car Controller scripts to your car object:
   - Select your car object in the Unity Scene view.
   - Drag and drop the following scripts from the **Scripts** folder onto your car object:
     - `CarAcceleration.cs`
     - `CarEngineShake.cs`
     - `CarRollOver.cs`
     - `CarTerrainContraints.cs`
     - `DownForceSpeed.cs`
     - `RampAirControl.cs`
     - `CarController.cs`
     - `HandBrake.cs`
     - `DirtSimulation.cs`

2. Configure the car controller parameters:
   - Adjust the variables exposed in the **Inspector** window of the attached scripts to fine-tune the car's behavior, such as acceleration, braking, and steering sensitivity.
   - Customize the camera settings to achieve the desired perspective and viewing angles.

3. Set up your game environment and track layout:
   - Design or import the terrain, roads, and other objects to create the driving environment.
   - Place checkpoints or waypoints to define the track or route.

4. Press the **Play** button in Unity to test and drive the car in your game.
